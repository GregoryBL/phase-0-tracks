# jQuery notes

## How to research JQuery?

I'll spend a little time learning about what jQuery is and what it does (I've written some jQuery before, so much of this will be refreshing my memory). Then I'll write an overview of important jQuery functions and properties and what they would be used for. As I go I'll test each one. Afterward I'll build a jQuery project to show some of what I've learned.

## Overview



## Important syntax and semantics
